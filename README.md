## **DES Encryption in CBC Mode**  

In this project, a group of three will implement a **Python function** to encrypt plaintext messages using the **DES (Data Encryption Standard) algorithm** in **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode**.  

### **Key Features**  
- Encrypts any given plaintext (e.g., *"Hello DES in CBC Mode"*) using DES in CBC mode.  
- Processes **64-bit blocks** with **16 round keys (48 bits each)**.  
- Runs **16 rounds of DES encryption** on each block.  
- Supports scaling for **larger messages** by chaining encrypted blocks in CBC mode.  

This implementation will provide a fundamental understanding of **block cipher encryption** and how CBC mode enhances security by incorporating **chaining dependencies** between blocks.
